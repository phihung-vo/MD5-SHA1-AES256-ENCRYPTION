# MD5-SHA1-AES256-ENCRYPTION
This project is about managing the logins of STUDENTs and STAFFs with some informations that are ENCRYPTED under many types on DATABASE.
And do the analyzing from the log created on SQL Server 2014 Management Studio (SSMS 2014).
The log file is LAB4_QLSV_CANHAN_031.txt, you should rename the file to LAB4_QLSV_CANHAN_031.trc so you can open it on SSMS 2014.
In the database, student's passwords are encrypted under MD5 Hash Encryption, staff's passwords are under SHA1 and staff's salaries are under AES256.
The QLSV folder is the Java Project built on Apache Netbeans 11.3.
